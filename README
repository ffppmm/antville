STATUS
======

Antville should be considered pre-release quality code. Although it is heavily
used by several thousands of users at http://antville.org and several other
sites (see http://code.google.com/p/antville/wiki/AntvilleSites) chances are
that there are still bugs hidden somewhere in this application. 

If you found one please report it at http://project.antville.org.

Antville can be used for production purposes, but please bear in mind that the
creators of Antville and Helma do not take any warranty (whichever kind).


===================
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

To run Antville you need Helma Object Publisher (http://helma.org) and a
relational database in the backend. Antville was tested with MySQL
(http://mysql.com) and PostgreSQL (http://postgresql.org).

For setting up Helma Object Publisher and the database of your choice please
refer to the corresponding installation instructions.

To enable Antville sending confirmation mails to users (e.g. after
registration) you will also need access to an SMTP server.

Helma comes with its own embedded webserver (Jetty) so you do not need to
install one, although you can easily use Apache httpd as front-end webserver,
too.

ABOUT ANTVILLE
==============

Antville is an open source project aimed to the development of an 
“easy to maintain and use” weblog hosting system. It can easily host 
up to several hundred or thousand weblogs (the number of weblogs is 
more limited by the site owner’s choice and server power than software 
limitations).

Antville is entirely written in JavaScript (ECMAScript, to be precise)
and based on Helma Object Publisher, a powerful and fast scriptable
open source web application server (which itself is written in Java).
Antville works with a relational database in the backend.

============================
ABOUT HELMA OBJECT PUBLISHER
============================

Helma Object Publisher is a web application server.

With Helma Object Publisher (sometimes simply referred to as Helma or 
Hop) you can define Objects and map them to a relational database 
table. These so-called HopObjects can be created, modified and deleted 
using a comfortable object/container model. Hence, no manual fiddling 
around with database code is necessary.

HopObjects are extended JavaScript objects which can be scripted using 
server-side JavaScript. Beyond the common JavaScript features, Helma 
provides special “skin” and template functionalities which facilitate 
the rendering of objects via a web interface.

Thanks to Helma’s relational database mapping technology, HopObjects 
create a hierarchical structure, the URL space of a Helma site. The 
parts between slashes in a Helma URL represent HopObjects (similar to 
the document tree in static sites). The Helma URL space can be thought 
of as an analogy to the Document Object Model (DOM) in client-side 
JavaScript.
