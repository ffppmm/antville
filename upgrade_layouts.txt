How to upgrade:

1) make a backup of the application directory, the directory where all static contents are stored and the database.
2) verify the integrity of your backup.
3) update to the main branch of antville in cvs.
4) run the db-patch db_support/patches/antville_dbpatch-20031123-layouts.sql

5) modify the structure of the static contents directory:

a) move all directories beneath /path/to/static/directory/images/ one level higher, so all the directories contain the images of the different sites are now located in /path/to/static/directory/
b) in each site directory move the image files into a newly created subdirectory called "images"
c) move all directories beneath /path/to/static/directory/files/ to the appropriate site directories in a newly created subdirectory called "files"
d) create a new directory /path/to/static/directory/layouts/default/
e) move the antville default images from the directory /path/to/static/directory/images/ into this directory

when you're finished, the structure of the static contents should eg. look like this

/usr/local/static/antville/myfirstsite
/usr/local/static/antville/myfirstsite/images
/usr/local/static/antville/myfirstsite/files

/usr/local/static/antville/mysecondsite
/usr/local/static/antville/mysecondsite/images
/usr/local/static/antville/mysecondsite/files

/usr/local/static/antville/layouts
/usr/local/static/antville/layouts/default
