<p><em>Note</em>: Since you are system administrator of this Antville installation you can also define "<% site.title %>" as its front page weblog. To do so simply enter "<% site.alias %>" (without the quotes) into the option "front page weblog" of the <% root.link to="manage/setup" text="system preferences" %>. If this weblog is set online it will replace the default front page (of course you can change that anytime you want).</p>
