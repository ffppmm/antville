<p>Note: Since you are <strong>System Administrator</strong> you can also define "<% site.title %>" as the frontpage weblog of this Antville installation. To do so simply enter "<% site.alias %>" (without the quotes) into the option <i>Frontpage Weblog</i> of the <% root.link to="manage/setup" text="System Preferences" %>. If this weblog is set online it will replace the standard frontpage (of course you can change that anytime you want).</p>
