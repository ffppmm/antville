<p><strong>Note</strong>: Since you are system administrator of this Antville installation you can also define "<% site.title %>" as its frontpage weblog. To do so simply enter "<% site.alias %>" (without the quotes) into the option <i>Frontpage Weblog</i> of the <% root.link to="manage/setup" text="system preferences" %>. If this weblog is set online it will replace the default frontpage (of course you can change that anytime you want).</p>
