<p><em>Note</em>: Since you are system administrator of this Antville 
installation you can also define "<% site.title %>" as its front page site. 
To do so simply enter <code><% site.name %></code> into the option 
"front page site" of the <% root.admin.link setup "system preferences" %>. 
If this site is open it will replace the default front page. 
(Of course you can change this setting anytime you want.)</p>
