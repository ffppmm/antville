<p>"<% site.title %>" is currently <% site.online no="<strong>offline</strong>, meaning that you are the only one that can access it.  Now you can safely start to customize it or to fill it with all the content you have in mind." yes="online, so its publicly accessible." %></p>
<p>The easiest way to customize your weblog is to change its <% site.link to="edit" text="preferences" %>: there you can choose different <% link to="edit" anchor="fonts" text="fonts" %> and <% link to="edit" anchor="colors" text="colors" %>, change the language and timezone or the main title of your weblog, switch it on- or offline and much more.</p>
<p>Of course you can now also start to create <% site.link to="stories/create" text="stories" %>, upload some <% site.link to="images/create" text="images" %> or <% site.link to="files/create" text="files" %>, create your first <% site.link to="polls/create" text="poll" %> ... or get a glimpse of Antville's wonderful customization possibilities by having a look at the <% site.link to="skins" %> that you can modify to your needs.</p>
<p>Have a lot of fun!</p>
