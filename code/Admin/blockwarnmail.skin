(You're receiving this mail because you are Administrator of <% param.site %>).

<% param.site %> (<% param.url %>) has been private for more than <% param.privatetime %> days. Due to policy reasons your site will be blocked in <% param.daysleft %> days if you keep it private. This does *not* mean that your site will be removed, but neither you nor other members of it will have access to <% param.site %> unless one of the system administrators decides to unblock your site.

So please either change the preferences of your site (select the checkbox "public") or send a mail to <% param.contact %> containing reasons why your site should stay private.
