(You're receiving this mail because you are Administrator of <% param.site %>).

<% param.site %> (<% param.url %>) has been private for more than <% param.privatetime %> days. Due to policy reasons your weblog will be blocked in <% param.daysleft %> days if you keep it private. This does *not* mean that your weblog will be removed, but neither you nor other members of it will have access to <% param.site %> unless one of the system administrators decides to unblock your weblog.

So please either change the preferences of your weblog (select the checkbox "public") or send a mail to <% param.contact %> containing reasons why your weblog should stay private.
