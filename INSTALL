Unpack the distribution file. Move the resulting directory “antville” into the
directory “apps” of your Helma Object Publisher installation.

Inside the directory “antville” you will find a directory called “db”. This
directory contains all database-related files, ie. several SQL scripts for
creating the database needed by the application. Change to that directory.

Antville currently comes with scripts for MySQL (my.sql) and for PostgreSQL 
databases (postgre.sql).

Each of these scripts create the tables, indexes and initial records and also
the account used by the application to communicate with the database. 

The default password of this account is “antville”, so you should change it if
you want to secure your installation. Open the desired SQL script and scroll
down to the “grant user” (for MySQL) or “create user” (for PostgreSQL)
statement. Search for “identified by” (for MySQL) or “password” (for
PostgreSQL) and change the trailing value in quotes to the password of your
choice.

Please refer to the documentation of your database on how to run the
appropriate script. After that you will have to tell Antville how it can
access your database. This is done in a configuration file named
“db.properties” which is located in the “code” directory.

Antville comes with two templates for this purpose, one for MySQL
(my.properties) and one for PostgreSQL (postgre.properties). Open the desired
template and ensure that the line beginning with “antville.url” points to
the server that runs the database. By default, this is the local machine aka
“localhost”.

Check that the password is set correctly to the one you entered in the SQL
script and save the file as “db.properties" (without the quotes) in the root
directory of the Antville application. You can safely overwrite it should it
already exist.

If not already done so you need to download and install the corresponding JDBC
driver for your database into the directory “lib/ext” of Helma’s installation
directory. As of writing this installation guide the drivers could be
downloaded via the following URLs:

 * http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html
 * http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ 

Finally, you need to tell Helma about the new application. This is done by
adding the contents of the file “apps.properties” in the “extra” directory to
the file “apps.properties” located in Helma’s installation directory.

NOTE: If you are using PostgreSQL you need to include line 5 of the original
file (the one defining “antville.repository.1”) by removing the leading
comment symbol “#”.

Now start up Helma and point your browser to

   http://localhost:8080/antville

(assuming that Helma is running on the same machine and uses port 8080).
You should see Antville’s start page where you need to register to gain system
administration rights to your Antville installation.

Have fun!

-----

TL;DR

1. Unpack distribution file
2. Move antville directory to helma/app directory
3. Change password in desired antville/db/*.sql script
4. Run SQL script
5. Copy antille/db/*.properties file to antville/code/db.properties
6. Change password in antville/code/db.properties file accordingly
7. Install corresponding JDBC driver in helma/lib/ext
8. Copy contents of antville/extra/apps.properties to helma/apps.properties
9. Start up Helma and browse to http://localhost:8080/antville
